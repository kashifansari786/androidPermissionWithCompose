**Android MVVM Architecture using Jetpack Compose and Kotlin**

This project is an example of implementing the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) architecture in Android using Jetpack Compose and Kotlin. It also covers how to handle Android permissions and works with Android 6.

**Requirements**

	1.Android Studio 4.0 or higher

	2.Android SDK version 23 or higher

**Project Overview**

This project demonstrates the use of the following:

	1.MVVM architecture pattern

	2.Jetpack Compose for UI development

	3.Kotlin for programming language

	4.Android Permissions handling

	5.Android 6 compatibility

**Getting Started**

	1.Clone the repository using the following command:

	2.Open Android Studio and select "Open an existing Android Studio project"
	
	3.Navigate to the cloned repository and select the build.gradle file in the root directory
	
	4.Build and run the project
	
**Permissions**

The project demonstrates how to handle Android permissions by requesting permissions at runtime. The code checks for the necessary permissions at runtime and requests them if they are not already granted.

**Compatibility**

The project is designed to be compatible with Android 6 (API level 23) and higher.

**MVVM Architecture**

The MVVM architecture separates the presentation logic from the business logic of an app. It uses a ViewModel to store and manage UI-related data and communicate with the Model, which is responsible for data manipulation and retrieval. The View interacts with the ViewModel to retrieve and display data.

**Jetpack Compose**

Jetpack Compose is a modern UI toolkit for building native Android apps. It allows developers to build UIs with composable functions, making it easy to create and customize UI elements.

**Kotlin**

Kotlin is a modern, statically typed programming language that runs on the Java Virtual Machine. It is designed to be concise, expressive, and safe.
